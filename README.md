DAY 19 #100DAYS OF CODE JAVASCRIPT EDITION

I know , I know lol it's been a while i pushed something to github.

My Color Flipper project was created to help you randomly select a background color for your projects. In the windows , you can  see the simple and the hex at the very top.

The simple has just few defined colors as seen from the code but the hex has randomly generate colors.

ANY CORRECTIONS? PLEASE REACH OUT TO ME
